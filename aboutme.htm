                    <p class="about-tittle">I have a deep passion for technology especially when it comes to figuring
                        out how websites are made and how they actually work behind the scenes. I've been teaching
                        myself a lot, diving into the world of web development to uncover its secrets. Right now, I'm a
                        student at El-Centro, learning web development. I'm excited to take on new challenges that will
                        help me get even better.</p>
